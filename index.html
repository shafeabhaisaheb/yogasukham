	        		 Tabla is a North Indian percussion instrument consisting of a set of two drums — a tonal drum tuned to a musical scale, and a bass drum. Tabla is a dynamic instrument with an extensive solo repertoire and also serves as the primary rhythmic accompaniment instrument for North Indian classical music. In the 20th century, tabla reached the masses worldwide as a result of the great work of masters like Ustad Alla Rakha and Pandit Kishan Maharaj. There are six main schools of tabla playing, named after the geographic regions in which they originated. Each school has its own unique style and approach to the instrument that differentiates it from the other schools.
